Hi. I am Tony Godson.

I have a degree in Computer Science from Nottingham Trent University.

I have been working in IT for 27 years.

I spent 15 years working at [Unisys](https://www.unisys.com/) starting as a graduate trainee progressing to Systems Architect.

I then moved to [Eclipse Group Solutions](https://www.eclipsegroup.co.uk/) continuing as a Systems architect, but evolving into an eCommerce Consultant working with SAP Commerce and Adobe Commerce. Picking up additional project management and business analysis skills as I went on.

The longer you work in IT the less technical you get, spending more and more of my time in Word, Excel, JIRA, Confluence and Lucidchart!

This blog will document my attempts to become more technical again, and to do some non-IT things
