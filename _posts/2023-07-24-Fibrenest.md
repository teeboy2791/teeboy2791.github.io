## About Fibrenest

![Fibrenest Logo]({{ site.url }}\assets\img\blue-logo.png)

If you have bought a Persimmon new build house in the last few years there is a good chance that you have been forced to have Fibrenest as a Broadband provided. 

Not all sites have Fibrenest there are three scenarios:

* You are a Fibrenest Site - if so you probably only have Fibrenest available to you - continue reading below
* You are a OFNL site - this is a 3rd party fibre company who install the cables, but you are free to choose your provider. However these are not the same providers as if you have BT
* You are a BT site, and you can get BT broadband or one of the common third party providers (Sky, Vodafone, Tesco etc...)

### Advantages of Fibrenest
* The main advantage of Fibrenest is that it generally installed for you when you get your new home, so you don't have to wait for BT or someone to visit and install cables in your house - traditionally this was difficult in a new build estate.
* Generally the cost is comparable with the RRP prices for BT and Virgin
* It is 100% fibre, so you can get Fibre speeds - with 2nd hand houses it is a lottery if you get fibre or traditional copper connections. They have speeds from 10Mbps to 500Mbps.
* For the last few years of inflation the prices have remained fixed

### Disadvantages
* You are tied to a single provider, so if you have problems then you have no alternative
* As there is no competition they only ever have RRP pricing, whilst this is not extortionate you don't get the occasional bargain offers from other providers
* Some providers offer even higher speeds. 500Mbps is generally enough for everyone, but some providers in the UK offer 1000Mbps or higher.
