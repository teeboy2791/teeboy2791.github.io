## Sailing

Something I have been planning to do for years is progress from dingy sailing to bigger boats. So I used this opportunity to try sailing on a big boat!

I used [Seafarer](https://seafarersailing.co.uk/rya-training-centres/greece/)

## Holiday

I got an early flight on 15th October 2023 from Manchester airport to Preveza, then a transfer to Nikiana Harbour in Lefkas.

We sailed around the Ionian to get some experience:

1. Sailing from Nikiana, Lefkas to Syvota, Lefkas
2. Crossing to Vathi in Ithica
3. Back to Lefkas - Vasiliki
4. Round to Nikiana, Lefkas for a night sail to Lefkas Town
5. Windy sail to Porto Spilia, Spartochori, Meganissi
6. Back to Nikiana, Lefkas

Then flew back to Manchester on 22nd October
